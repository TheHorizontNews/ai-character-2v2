The AI engineer's work pivoted from static site generation back to the original React application due to user feedback on design and preview issues. The primary focus has been on building comprehensive platform comparison features. This involved creating comparison hub and directory pages, then implementing detailed individual comparison pages with interactive charts, SEO blocks, and dynamic content. Significant effort was dedicated to styling, mobile responsiveness, and ensuring all content, including dynamically generated SEO descriptions, was visually appealing and correctly centered. Recurring challenges included duplicate code declarations, precise CSS adjustments for various screen sizes, and ensuring navigation correctly positioned users at the top of new pages. The engineer also added multiple SEO-optimized content blocks and redesigned existing sections on both comparison detail and homepage, responding to iterative user feedback for specific aesthetic and functional improvements.

The initial goal was to clone  as , an AI character review site supporting 21 platforms, featuring pixel-perfect design, mobile responsiveness, and SEO. The React frontend was built with mock data, including a redesigned tabbed comparison, dedicated category pages with SEO blocks and FAQs, enhanced platform detail pages, and a navigation system for 67 SEO-optimized pages. An attempt was made to convert this to a static HTML/CSS/JS site. However, due to preview system issues and user preference, the focus shifted back to the *original React application* to add comprehensive comparison features. This includes interactive visualizations, SEO blocks, comparison against all other brands, featuring Lovescape, advanced search, user reviews, and a platform finder quiz.
