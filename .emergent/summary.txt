The AI engineer successfully built a pixel-perfect clone of lovescape.com, adapting it into an AI character review site. The process involved extensive frontend development, beginning with a mock-data-driven UI. The engineer iteratively addressed user feedback, first by fixing layout issues and then by implementing comprehensive mobile responsiveness. A key redesign involved transforming a traditional comparison table into an interactive, tabbed card-based section for 21 platforms. Dynamic navigation, including a desktop sidebar and mobile burger menu, was integrated. Dedicated category pages with SEO blocks and FAQs were added, followed by data visualization and additional SEO blocks on individual platform detail pages. The current task focuses on implementing a large set of 67 new SEO content pages, for which the engineer has started structuring data and creating template components and navigation.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a pixel-perfect clone of lovescape.com, repurposed as an AI character review site. The application needs to feature 21 specific AI character creation platforms, including Lovescape, Character.AI, Replika, etc. Key design elements, layout, colors, fonts, images, animations, and responsive behavior should mirror the original site. The site must incorporate brand overview tables, SEO blocks, and calls to action. The development prioritized frontend implementation with mock data, followed by backend integration (not yet started).

So far, the AI engineer has implemented:
- A complete frontend clone with mock data.
- Full mobile responsiveness across all sections.
- A redesigned, tabbed comparison section to manage 21 platforms, categorized into Top 5, Premium Tier, Romantic Focus, and Emerging.
- Dedicated category pages (Featured, Premium, Romantic, Trending, Community), each with two SEO blocks (text and image, alternating layouts) and an FAQ section.
- Enhanced platform detail pages for all 21 platforms, including a data visualization block (stats, progress bars) and an additional SEO content block.
- A navigation system with a desktop sidebar and a mobile burger menu, dynamically routing to home, category, and comparison pages.
