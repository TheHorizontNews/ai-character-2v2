The AI engineer's work evolved through two distinct phases: an initial, extensive effort to convert a React application into a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript website, followed by a pivot to integrate new comparison features directly into the *original React application* based on user feedback. The static site conversion successfully generated over 100 pages, including SEO, platform, and category pages, and proved functional in local testing. However, persistent issues with the preview environment displaying cached or simplified designs, and a user request to add comparison logic to the original version of the site, prompted the shift back to the React codebase. The AI engineer successfully implemented the comparison hub and an All Comparisons directory within the React application, complete with dynamic routing and a preserved minimalist design. The current task involves building the detailed individual comparison pages within this React framework.

The core requirement was cloning  as , an AI character review site, supporting 21 platforms with a pixel-perfect design, mobile responsiveness, and SEO. Initial implementation delivered a React frontend with mock data, a redesigned tabbed comparison, dedicated category pages with two SEO blocks and FAQs, enhanced platform detail pages with data visualization, a navigation system, and 67 SEO-optimized pages with cross-linking, visual enhancements, and authentic branding. An attempt to convert the entire app to a static HTML/CSS/JS site, preserving all features, was initiated. However, due to preview system issues and a strong user preference, the task pivoted. The current focus is to add comprehensive platform comparison features to the *original React application*, including interactive visualizations, SEO blocks, comparison against all other brands, and featuring Lovescape prominently. This also encompasses adding an advanced search, user reviews, and a platform finder quiz.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently engaged in implementing the comparison features within the *original React application* after pivoting from static site conversion due to user feedback on design and preview issues.

Specifically:
1.  **Sidebar Navigation**: The  component has been updated to include new Compare and All Comparisons links with appropriate icons, preserving the minimalist design.
2.  **Comparison Hub Page**: A new  component and its corresponding  have been created. This page serves as a hub, showcasing Popular Comparisons with visual previews, ratings, pricing, and descriptions. It is fully functional and integrated into the React router.
3.  **All Comparisons Directory**: A new  component and its  have been created. This page provides a comprehensive directory with a search bar, brand filter, and statistics on live and upcoming comparisons. It is also fully functional and integrated.
4.  **Routing**: The  file has been updated to correctly route to  and .
5.  **Next Phase**: The AI engineer has just created  to begin implementing the individual detailed comparison pages, which will feature interactive charts and in-depth analysis for each  combination.
The current state is that the comparison hub and directory are fully integrated and verified in the React application, and the engineer is moving to build out the individual comparison pages.
